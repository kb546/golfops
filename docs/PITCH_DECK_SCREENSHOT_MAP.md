Last updated: February 14, 2026

## Slide-to-screenshot mapping

| Slide | Narrative Goal | Route | Filename |
|---|---|---|---|
| 03 | Product first impression | `/` | `home.png` |
| 04 | Platform breadth | `/features` | `features.png` |
| 05 | Commercial model | `/pricing` | `pricing.png` |
| 06 | Team/mission credibility | `/about` | `about.png` |
| 07 | Sales readiness / buyer contact | `/contact` | `contact.png` |
| 08 | Product proof (operations dashboard) | `/dashboard` | `dashboard-overview.png` |

## Capture posture

- Use `?present=1` mode for clean screenshots.
- Capture only desktop orientation for deck consistency.
- Use the same viewport for every route.

## Naming policy

- Keep canonical names from `artifacts/visual-baseline/README.md`.
- Do not overwrite approved images without re-review.
